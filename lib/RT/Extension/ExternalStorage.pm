=head1 NAME

RT::Extension::ExternalStorage - Store attachments outside the database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Set( @Plugins, 'RT::Extension::ExternalStorage' );

    Set(%ExternalStorage,
        Type => 'Disk',
        Path => '/opt/rt4/var/attachments',
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

By default, RT stores attachments in the database.  This extension moves
all attachments that RT does not need efficient access to (which include
textual content and images) to outside of the database.  This may either
be on local disk, or to a cloud storage solution.  This decreases the
size of RT's database, in turn decreasing the burden of backing up RT's
database, at the cost of adding additional locations which must be
configured or backed up.

The files are initially stored in the database when RT receives them;
this guarantees that the user does not need to wait for the file to be
transferred to disk or to the cloud, and makes it durable to transient
failures of cloud connectivity.  The provided C<bin/extract-attachments>
script, to be run regularly via cron, takes care of moving attachments
out of the database at a later time.

=head1 INSTALLATION

=over

=item C<perl Makefile.PL>

=item C<make>

=item C<make install>

May need root permissions

=item Edit your F</opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm>

If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

    Plugin('RT::Extension::ExternalStorage');

For RT 4.0, add this line:

    Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::ExternalStorage));

or add C<RT::Extension::ExternalStorage> to your existing C<@Plugins> line.

You will also need to configure the C<%ExternalStorage> option,
depending on how and where you want your data stored; see
L</CONFIGURATION>.

=item Restart your webserver

Restarting the webserver before the next step (extracting existing
attachments) is important to ensure that files remain available as they
are extracted.

=item Extract existing attachments

Run C<bin/extract-attachments>; this may take some time, depending on
the existing size of the database.  This task may be safely cancelled
and re-run to resume.

=item Schedule attachments extraction

Schedule C<bin/extract-attachments> to run at regular intervals via
cron.  For instance, the following F</etc/cron.d/rt> entry will run it
daily, which may be good to concentrate network or disk usage to times
when RT is less in use:

    0 0 * * * root /opt/rt4/local/plugins/RT-Extension-ExternalStorage/bin/extract-attachments

=head1 CONFIGURATION

This module comes with a number of possible backends; see the
documentation in each for necessary configuration details:
