NAME
    RT::Extension::ExternalStorage - Store attachments outside the database

SYNOPSIS
        Set( @Plugins, 'RT::Extension::ExternalStorage' );

        Set(%ExternalStorage,
            Type => 'Disk',
            Path => '/opt/rt4/var/attachments',
        );

DESCRIPTION
    By default, RT stores attachments in the database. This extension moves
    all attachments that RT does not need efficient access to (which include
    textual content and images) to outside of the database. This may either
    be on local disk, or to a cloud storage solution. This decreases the
    size of RT's database, in turn decreasing the burden of backing up RT's
    database, at the cost of adding additional locations which must be
    configured or backed up.

    The files are initially stored in the database when RT receives them;
    this guarantees that the user does not need to wait for the file to be
    transferred to disk or to the cloud, and makes it durable to transient
    failures of cloud connectivity. The provided bin/extract-attachments
    script, to be run regularly via cron, takes care of moving attachments
    out of the database at a later time.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::ExternalStorage');

        For RT 4.0, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::ExternalStorage));

        or add RT::Extension::ExternalStorage to your existing @Plugins
        line.

        You will also need to configure the %ExternalStorage option,
        depending on how and where you want your data stored; see
        "CONFIGURATION".

    Restart your webserver
        Restarting the webserver before the next step (extracting existing
        attachments) is important to ensure that files remain available as
        they are extracted.

    Extract existing attachments
        Run bin/extract-attachments; this may take some time, depending on
        the existing size of the database. This task may be safely cancelled
        and re-run to resume.

    Schedule attachments extraction
        Schedule bin/extract-attachments to run at regular intervals via
        cron. For instance, the following /etc/cron.d/rt entry will run it
        daily, which may be good to concentrate network or disk usage to
        times when RT is less in use:

            0 0 * * * root /opt/rt4/local/plugins/RT-Extension-ExternalStorage/bin/extract-attachments
